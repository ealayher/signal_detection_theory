Calculations for signal detection theory

**sdt_measures.m**  
Function that calculates discriminability (d' and A') and criterion values (c, c', beta, ln(beta), B'').

**sdt_optimal_c.m**  
Function that calculates the optimal criterion given a level of d' and the target probability.

**sdt_payout2probs.m**  
Function that converts a biased payout structure into the equivalent target probability value to compute optimal criterion.
