Calculations for signal detection theory

**normc.R** (obsolete: **normalized_criterion.m**)
Function that residualizes c with d' to get normalized c values

**sdt.R** (obsolete: **sdt_measures.m**)  
Function that calculates signal detection measures: c, d', Beta, ln(Beta) [equal or unequal variance (least squares fit of zROC slope)].

**sdt_optimal_c.m**  
Function that calculates the optimal criterion given a level of d' and the target probability.

**sdt_payout2probs.m**  
Function that converts a biased payout structure into the equivalent target probability value to compute optimal criterion.
